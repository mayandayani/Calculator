# Calculator

Calculator Project that was a tutorial from The Odin Project.

I went through a few variations of this project, I struggled with remembering the positioning layout for CSS at first. Afterwards it was quite challenging to create the buttons and to have JavaScript take the actual values of the buttons when they were clicked. Lastly the evalulate portion was a challenge as I had not known about the eval syntax to calculate the result. Overall this was an interesting experience in dealing with fundamental JavaScript.
